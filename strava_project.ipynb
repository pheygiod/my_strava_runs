    "The purpose of this project is to explore my sports activity patterns througohut the last year. I like to go for long runs, practice sports such as tennis and padel, and sometimes go to the gym when it's rainy outside. The platform that I use to keep track of my physical activities is Strava, an American internet service for tracking physical exercise which also has the features of a social media. It's a nice platform where I can look back at my average pace of my fast runs, look at the maps of my long runs, and get motivated by receiving kudos from my friends and vice versa!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyse my activity on my JupyterLab, I need to scrape the data from my Strava account (through the APIs they provide), and download it locally. I read [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-the-strava-api-and-pandas-to-explore-your-activity-data-d94901d9bfde) online article which helped me in the process of downloading the necessary tools to test Strava APIs, getting access and refresh tokens, and finally getting the data with Python. Would highly recommend to anybody who's new to APIs and would like to give it a go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once I've done that, I then started exploring my data through publicly available libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. After having cleansed my data, I aimed at answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What's the most frequent activity that I've performed in the past year?\n",
    "- What's the most common run distance I've performed in the past few years?\n",
    "- Has my average pace decreased during my fast, 5km runs throughout the past year?\n",
    "- In which country/ county did I exercise the most in the past years?"

We can also observe the diversity in sports which took place in August and September. This might be because of the nice weather thus the multiple activities which can be practiced outdoor.

    "- My average pace decreased during my fast, 5km runs throughout the past year, with a constant up-and-down rhythm between 4:30 /km and 5:00 /km. A reason could be that I set myself the goal of improving my running performance for the Trail Half Marathon in June 2023, thus aimed at running my 5km runs better and faster.\n",

    "- Design some time series visualisations to track my fitness progress over time, including metrics such as heart rate and calories burned. \n",
    "- Create a radar chart or parallel coordinate plots to compare my performance with the one of my partner or my friends across different statistical categories.\n",
